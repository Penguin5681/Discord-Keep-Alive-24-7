The [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) is the main file. [keep_alive.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) prevents your repl from going to sleep. (If you have a replit hacker plan or want to run the script locally, then you can delete [this file](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) and paste this code inside the [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) file:

```py
import discord
import os
from discord.ext import commands

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix=':', self_bot=True, help_command=None)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
  await client.change_presence(status=discord.Status.online)
  os.system('clear')
  print(f'Logged in as {client.user} (ID: {client.user.id})')

client.run(os.getenv("TOKEN"))
```
